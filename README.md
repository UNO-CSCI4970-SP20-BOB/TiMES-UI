# TiMES UI
>UI Design for TiMES application
>
>This represents a static representation of how the end UI design will be generated by the [TiMES] application.

## Installing
>
>This project uses [Node.js] and [npm]. With npm, open a console in the folder with package.json and install the package using `npm install`. This project uses [gulp.js] to manage building and running the application. Use `gulp --tasks` to show all tasks.

## Development
>
>Using gulp, the source code can be automatically packaged and served using the command `gulp dev` (or just `gulp`). This command runs a sequence of other gulp tasks. Gulp will move and package files to the output folder and start a local webserver from these files. It will also watch for file changes and rebuild/reload as needed.

## Documentation
>
>This project uses [JSDoc] for JavaScript documentation generation. Documentation can be generated by using the command `gulp buildDocs`. The documentation will be built into the folder `./docs` and can be view by opening `index.html`.
